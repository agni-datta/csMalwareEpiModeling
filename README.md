# csMalwareEpiModeling

This repository contains code implementing epidemiological models to simulate malware propagation in computer networks using Jupyter Notebooks. It serves as a platform for an ongoing research project to understand and analyse the dynamics of malware spread within computer networks.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a framework for researchers and practitioners to study the behaviour of malware within computer networks. By employing epidemiological models, researchers can simulate various scenarios and analyze the impact of different factors on the spread of malware. This can aid in developing strategies for malware prevention, detection, and mitigation.

## Contents

The repository includes the following components:

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** These notebooks implement epidemiological models for simulating malware propagation. Each notebook focuses on a specific model or aspect of malware spread.
- **Data:** This directory contains any datasets or input files required for running the simulations.
- **Results:** After running the simulations, the results, including plots, graphs, and analysis, will be stored in this directory.
- **Documentation:** This directory contains any supplementary documentation, including user guides, model descriptions, and references.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including Python and Jupyter Notebook.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Open the desired notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Follow the instructions within the notebook to configure the simulation parameters and run the simulation.
6. Analyze the results and interpret the findings.
